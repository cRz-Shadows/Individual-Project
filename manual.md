## Running Simulations Yourself
If you wish to run a set of simulations, everything you need is located in the 'Data' directory. You can create or use a predefined input file in 'Inputs' subdirectory, then run countPokemon.py to get matchups for teams of 2, or run getTeamsOf6.py to get matchups for teams of 6. From there just just have to run getSimulations.py. Note you will have to modify some lines in each file to use the specific input files you want. Battles with errors can be rerun using get_battles_to_rerun.py, findErrors.py and removeErrors.py. Analysis can be performed using parseOutput.py and analyseOutputMatrix.py.
